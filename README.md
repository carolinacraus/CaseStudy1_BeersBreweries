## Introduction 

The main objective of this analysis is to add value to Budweiser company
through our exploratory data analysis. We have discovered several
interesting opportunities throughout this study. We are positive that
this analysis will enhance Budweiser's strategic decision making and
open a few doors for future opportunities.

## Datasets

1. **Beers.csv**: The Beers dataset contains 2,410 beers that are being produced in the United States along with metrics for ABV (Alcohol by Volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), Style, and ounces and includes the Brewery ID associated with that beer.
2. **Breweries.csv**: The Breweries dataset contains 558 Breweries in the United States along with the Brewery ID (which matches with the one from the Beers dataset) and which city and state it is located in.
